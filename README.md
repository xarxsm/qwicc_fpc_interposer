# qwicc_fpc_interposer
I had a need to monitor temperature inside a refrigerator and log temperature through Adafruit I/O. In order to have the best seal, I wanted to use an FPC connection to the temperature sensor using the QWICC connection for quick development. I created this QWICC to FPC interposer to allow me to use FPC cables with QWICC. This is a quick board I created for that purpose. I have also created a temperature sensor that hooks up directly to FPC. Note that pin numbers on the JST are inverted on the FPC connection. Once could use two FPC interposers as well.
